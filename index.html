I don’t know how to perfectly explain what you mean to me, but I know one thing for sure — my world feels calmer, brighter, and more complete with you in it.

From the day I confessed my feelings, something quietly changed inside me. I started smiling more, hoping more, dreaming more… all because of you. You became my favorite thought, my comfort on hard days, and the reason my good days feel even better.

I love the way you exist — your little habits, your smile, the way you make ordinary moments feel special. You don’t even try, yet you make my heart feel at home.

This website is small compared to what I feel, but it holds memories, music, moments, and words that all lead back to you. I made this for you, because you deserve something as gentle and beautiful as the love you’ve given me.

No matter where life takes us, know that you’ll always have a special place in my heart — today, tomorrow, and every day after.

With all my love,
Yours, always ❤️
